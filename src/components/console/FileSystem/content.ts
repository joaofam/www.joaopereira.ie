export const careerContent = `# Tech Career Summary

---

As a software engineer with 4 years of Full Stack development (university and work), I have defined my skills in application and CLI development as well as infrastructure.

I am particularly interested in Linux and Open Source technologies, though my interests span across various platforms and technologies (just not Haskell and Assembly). My approach combines technical proficiency with a keen eye for design, allowing me to create solutions that are not only functional but also visually appealing.

## About Me
Usually week-by-week, within the job, I code for 35 hours a week and spend the rest either in a meeting or eating lunch.

Other than that, I like to explore different hobbies and skillsets so life doesnt become too stale. Some of my hobbies include street photography, fitness [football and gym], music and cycling as well as the wallet-draining hobby of collecting Lego.

I plan to utilise this space as a hub for myself in regards to anything tech as well as sharing insights and experiences.
