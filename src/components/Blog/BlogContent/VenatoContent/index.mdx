# Fileflo

<br />
**Fileflo** is a secure, user-friendly, and decentralised file-sharing platform
that leverages the power of the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** and
**blockchain technology**. By utilising IPFS, Fileflo enables peer-to-peer file
sharing across a distributed network of nodes, ensuring high availability,
resilience, and eliminating reliance on centralised servers.
<br />
<br />
To prioritise user privacy and security, Fileflo uses advanced symmetric and
asymmetric encryption algorithms, ensuring that only authorised users can access
shared files.
<br />
<br />
File metadata, including IPFS hashes, is stored on the **Ethereum blockchain**,
providing an immutable record of file provenance and history while preventing
tampering or deletion. Filefloâ€™s intuitive interface makes it easy to upload,
share, and download files, as well as create shared folders for seamless
collaboration among teams and groups.
